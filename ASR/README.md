# Automatic Speech Recognition
This folder contains the scripts used to preprocess and train the automatic speech recognition system.

Scripts starting with "batch*" are used to start running the jobs in a SLURM cluster. The scripts are the following:
1. `preprocessing.sh` - Preprocesses the data.
2. `run.sh` - Trains the ASR model.
