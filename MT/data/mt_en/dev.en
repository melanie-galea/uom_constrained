a closer look at certain themes and their treatment can show us that there are cases
"where rather than a reaction there was a continuation, how you react to this?"
the Literary Awakening Movement used to publish the magazine Il-Polz
we believe that if we want to be able to continue to be proud of our ancient civilization
we need to teach our people to appreciate literature and culture
"we need to teach our people, also the shipyard workers, the factory workers, and those who repair the roads"
to appreciate literature so that they too can eat from that food that nourishes the spirit
with the aim of seeing our people appreciate culture and literature more
"the literary revival movement was established only, do you believe that you have reached this goal? "
do you think that in order to appreciate poetry one must first of all understand what the poet is trying to say?
or is it not so important that the message is understood since it is open to so many interpretations
"you included, sometimes they are too complex for what they have to say to be understood by the general public?"
"what you have in mind when you write a poem, is important for the reader to understand?"
that is to say but in a few words either the interpretation e
and you have to tell me what you understood or the first thing that comes to your mind when I read d it to you
why this charm of happiness when I know that I have nothing maybe because I have myself but myself tomorrow will die.
before we go into detail in them I would like to ask you what you think about
what is a myth as soon as you hear the word myth what comes to your mind
a genre as we have also heard from the experience of the audience itself that this genre has developed
by word of mouth then you must consider that in an illiterate world this could be said to have developed spontaneously
and apart from that erm the audience used to incorporate both adults and children
therefore it would have been simpler for everyone to understand it
because both dictionaries focus on both the magical element and the allegorical function
and by that through them we are explaining exactly what a myth is
"on the other hand, magic originally referred to a wise man who was also"
a member of the class oof the sacerdotal class and over time began to associate itself with people
they had the ability to make the radical change in a wonderful way like witches this shows how much
magic is rather a dynamic wisdom because from a belief that
protects from all danger and beliefs of supernatural rites and incantations
this over time magic ended becaming spectacular in an entertaining way it gives a spectacular aspect to people
as an effect the the the audience when the when watching a magical proceeding
of course the process is explainable but when you see the effect of magic effect the audience is like
incurs curiosity and they see it as a strange thing and at the same time
you see something that is unusual that cannot be done in everyday life
george mifsud chircop was appointed as president of the mal maltese teachers union in ninety four
also a scholar of folklore and ethno-ethnography of the Maltese islands
he had published and edited a large number of books including the book we had to constantly refer to
to do so as to give an example for our analysis as normal allegorical
of as a journey we are telling the story of the myth on which you are building you are building the f-the myth on
now it is good to say that generally a myth it is built on three stages
the first stage is when the hero has left his village to start the adventure iii
his second stage is when he meets his aide or the donor or it can be the same character
and the last stage is when the hero tries to win his battle until he reaches the expected end
we also have the temporary journey that fits more with the ele-magic basically follows the same structure
because as we said the myth has a linear and chronological plot
but in truth when we introduce the magical element into it we can see that there is a change in times this is why
first we can say the first way is by having a jump in the future
this can happen during the meeting between the aide and the donor donor and the hero eee this
of course it is evident when the adjutant is giving valuable advice to the hero
what should he do then you the fact that he is telling you what to do is giving you a warning of what is coming
he begins to tell him for you apart from that the donor also gives the magical objects the weapons with which
lhe will be able to escape from falling under any obstacle of the hero apart from that too
we have the look back in the journey this also appears in fact in the same meeting
with the helper or the donor when he explains apart from that as we can see the adjutant has the experience
in that it is already showing you thathe went through it and he didn't succeed so he tries
he guides the hero and does not follow the step he has taken but at the same time for example
there have been cases of fairy tales where the donor has fallen under the obstacles of the villain
and has a transformation in an animalistic appearance what happens in that case the
the donor tries to help the hero so that when he succeeds
he also gains because he finally turns back turns back into a human form
a point I would like to mention in these three journeys I kept noticing how even though the hero leaves independent
and he is seen as indifferent by society because he picks up and goes off on his own adventure anyway he is still dependent
for the fact that he wants help to reach the end of his journey now here we will discuss in more detail
the character of the hero the main character often of the myth who often appears as one
with many values full of va-e values emm we often associate it with the good and not with the bad
"as Jolene told us, he cuts himself off from the rest of society so that he not only gets his reward"
and maybe he gets to his main goal but also
erm to help the the rest of society and those who have and those who need it
"as it is also written here, the decisions he takes affect the rest of society, not just him"
here we have a reference to from The Myth of the Wonder of Water he who does good in the world frees
that is why he emm is so important in society a maidne from the water society where he shows-makes it clear that he is that she is
but I would like to stop you a little bit here okay becuase it may be the case that the hero has a purpose in his mind
the fact that it is true that he goes to help tho those who need it for example
the king's daughter he goes to help her but it may happen that the purpose and intention behind it is to improve the
his social status the fact that he tries to do everything and thus convinces the king
to take his daughter's hand and apart from that what does he acquire not only love but maybe from
a state of poverty he is raising his level and thus taking his permanent place with the authorities
"he appears as a strong male figure, intellectually strong "
because he has authority and he knows wisdom and apart from that the old man is very similar to a sorcerer
the fact that during the tale just just like a sorcerer does the magical action
in its right place and time and perhaps in an abandon in a secret and abandoned place the same as the old man looks
throughout the tale an opportune moment appears for the hero just before he begins his search
and this is giving more possibility that that the magical element appears more present in this figure
the snake that is implying deceit and deception is a representation of the villain
the same with the white dove that presents the concept of genuineness and purity that is the
you can say a secondary character made under the guise of the villain in an innocent way
and apart from that we can say that with the effort of magic and here once again he changed his appearance
from you can say he wa a prince from a pure prince under the dupe of the villain and he appeared in the form of a horse
now let's move to the inanimate objects these inanimate objects stand out the most because they are rich
they are also decisive in the fact that one can say that without them the hero
because you can say we can capture the social status of the hero as from a poor man with these objects
that even the appearance of the clothing where one beings as a servant
and so her clothing will be worn and worthless from a piece from a piece of almond
she makes the best outfit and that's how she gets to be the princess
apart from that as you also mentioned in the temporary journey eee you can say that the inanimate objects too
they are clues giving an indication now on what will happen in the future because three different animalesque kingdoms
they had to give a thorn to the hero and tell him when you need to touch it and we'll be there that shows that with time
"he will need them and in fact this is what happens in the tale, that he uses it also when the old man"
gives him advice and at the same time he gives him weapons and tells him givse him every step of what he should do for that
"that is like, well not is like, it is a prediction of what will happen and it is further convincing the hero how he should"
"go through his adventure, of course the inanimate objects will serve as a measure of good and a measure of bad"
"depending on the attitude of the character,  according to who has offered them to him as well, exactly whether or not the aide has offered them"
"to the hero, or whether it was the villain who used emm these objects, then we have the repetition of the number"
"there are also the formulas and the numbers, now from my research I could notice that the number three is"
"it appears regularly in fairy tales when I researched about it, regarding magic I discovered that the sense of three shows"
so when I started to see the fairy tales and I came up with examples here that always
in many in many fairy tales I could see that for example the inanimate object serves three it is eee in three
there are the walnuts the almonds the chestnuts which also translate into the best clothes and which
you always open open one every three days and then another example of the three kingdoms
there we are seeing a sense of completeness it must be that e the number three shows that
it's gathering everything even if we flip and actually three brothers we also have three brothers too
at the beginning of these they appear at the beginning of the tale where there are three brothers and they try
they take on their first challenge to see if they are able to start their adventure now from these three brothers
"the youngest one succeeds, apart from that I could also see the number three was"
to give him everything that is needed because there were some tales - there are some tales where there is repetition too
"always the rank, the chance always increases as christabelle said the helper is not necessarily one"
the three brothers and the three old men I saw a paradoxical element here because the youngest of the brothers
"he succeeds, whilst from the oldest and wisest of the three old men who can help make the journey"
it leads to going into another part of this presentation of ours and the binary opposites in the tal
"the fairy tales the fairy tales are full of opposites, the greatest opposite is the one between the good"
they show how when you think about the good without meaning too to think you also think about qualities of evil 
"if for example I tmention to you beauty, unwittingly you'll start thinking about the opposite"
"so they seem to be treated together, you cannot have one without having the other"
"here too we can see that the magical element also comes in, for the fact that there is no proceedi-, there is no special procedure - that"
"to explain how from ugly he transforms himself into the most beautiful, you can say into the most beautiful prince"
"he convinced the king to take his daughter's hand, in fact as I just said that"
they unfold mostly when the character is in contact with a magical entity and we also see how
the qualities of the helper and the hero take on positive connotations whilst those of the villain
"in contrast they take negative connotations, however still"
they can develop themselves because of the fact that there is a sense of manipulation in them
it's like the clothing seems to represent you in which social state you are at the moment
of course as we are saying now this does not mean only economically now also
"you take with you to continue the adventure, for the fact that we can see this part here where I could conclude how"
when the protagonist leaves with nothing on an adventure without a clue he takes nothing with him
"he thinks he will continue his adventure in the middle of the journey, he will destroy that, he will get everything he needs"
"for the adventure to proceed and take place, until then of course the adventure comes to an end"
it shows how here at the beginning also the protagonist was seen as poor because without valuable advice
"and without magical tools I don't know how far he would have reached his goal, the poor is not entirely good and the rich is not entirely"
"all bad, very often we associate the poor with the good and the rich with the bad"
it is also good to mention that the rich even though he seems to have everything he wan he can think of
"it still appears in this case, in the Tale of the Months that he is ni- that he is envious of what others can have"
"so in all truth he does not have a certain wealth even though he is rich, now apart from that"
"the fact that when you see him for the first time you think he has no values, you think how can he be from"
a feather makes it to the stem and then and then a ship comes out that can move on the ground so therefore from
"a tangible object that has no value in it, it can really really"
be turned into something that is prestigious and it is something that he had long wanted to be
"the part we can say, that also to continue with the semiotics of light and darkness"
we can also associate it with white magic and black magic because white magic leaves a positive effect
basically it is more linked to the magic performed by the aide
while black magic is conno-has negative connotations that and this is
"linked to the villain, many times that is the point that Christabelle made that i agree with, the colors too"
"they appear and give an indication of what will happen further on, in fact that let me take the example of the ring again"
that this is given as an inanimate and magical object eee and it turns black and the color changes
"and that shows the warning that that something bad will happen, apart from that there was also there"
connotations of the color white in fact that for example the white dove that shows that
she is not the villain she is rather an innocent secondary character whereas the villain
"he takes on the image of a black maiden, so in this way a lot the dark, the stuffiness, the ugliness"
many are associated with the villain and this can show that the fairy tales sometimes they are still ra
"cist also because the the black is the bad, the white the good like here the"
"besides it can also be racist to a certain extent, it also shows its simplicity because it shows that there is no development in it"
"because you, if you see something you start familiarizing with them, if you see white you say ok it is good"
"you see the black say it is bad, and also because we said at the beginning that it was told by"
in a world of illiterate people these connotations would help people understand more
"because if they started associating with the bad, maybe that person would have, maybe"
he would have stumbled and he would have not fully understood the meaning of the tale
"during my research I could see how for magic to proceed in tale, there is a need for the two figures"
both the hero and the old man because of the fact that there is a point of reciprocity in them because of the fact that
although the hero appears as you could say the youngest of the brothers then it indicates that he is small
"and he has the physical strength that can carry out the adventure, he men-but truthfully he does not have the knowledge"
"of what he should, so then he needs the old man whereas the old man even though he has all the knowledge"
of what should happen and how he can accomplish everything he does not have enough strength to do it
"in fact we have here an example of the extremely old man in the tale, The Old Man Buried in the Cave"
"we return to the the black one here also, because since he was decrepit until the latter"
"he also recognized that if the elderly are not good for everything, they should also be worth for advice"
"we come now to the manipulation, I have already mentioned talked a littl bit about it"
however this also shows up  a lot in Maltese fairy tales especially the magical element we can simply pay attention to
"where I could see that some fables, the orders seem semantically irrelevant and"
grammatically impossible because as far as I know I have never tried to open a door by telling him to close it
"a tale, the one who loves his mother or the Maltese Samson, the same happened in order for them to open the hatch they shouted the command Close"
apart from that in the underworld and we also that for the aide to help the protagonist
"he started so that every time you tell him give me something to drink, the protagonist has to give her something to eat what happens with that"
this is rather not easy due to the fact that it can quickly become an obstacle for the protagonist
the manipulation can also occur by changing the physical appearance but this often occurs
from the villain by trying to convince and persuade other characters with false behavior
and with another identity where we also see that this happens with magic in fact
you can say that from the appearance of a human figure he changes either to an animal or
"otherwise to whatever he always desires, so then what can we see? That magic always tries to fulfill what he is"
possible and what is desirable what humanity always desires
"apart from that we can see as the example the Serpentine, in the tale Eight he frees the daughter of the"
"king from the dragon Draganti, where he changes he transforms himself into a man with golden teeth"
"in order to convince the king so that he can acquire his daughter, in addition the manipulation can also take place"
"with the secondary characters, and this we have already discussed before as well e that change"
due to the villain's anyway but these will be more like a test for him before
"on them to see if it succeeds, so that eventually when he gets to meeting the hero he can do the same again"
even though in fairy tales it seems that he never succeeds because the hero is already
"advised in advance about what he should do, apart from this condition that they know in advance what"
the secondary characters apart from already having experienced this this
"situation where they fell into deception, this will be of gain for the hero for the fact that"
they will know what he should do and at the same time for the secondary characters they will know if the hero acts in a way
"that is good and that he will succeed in everything, they will gain from regaining their physical appearance"
so we can see that although we can see that there is suffering from the negative metamorphosis
and you can say that with them we have found a lot in common both in the two elements one can say and also
there was an element of reciprocity between the two elements because for the magic to happen it needed the representation-
"simplified into flat characters, still to succeed they still needed the magical element to happen"
that to make that change happen then you can say that there was a certain flexibility even
so we can also say that as a magical entity in fairy tales it generates a crucial relationship
the plot is decisive for the protagonist due to the fact that you can say he got where he always wanted
and it is surprising for the readers due to the fact that magic the fact that it shows the impossibility
"it surprises you due the fact that you will see something that you never imagined, that you will get to do and see in fairy tales"
"and also the fact that as we have been mentioning a lot, that it is a simple plot with flat characters"
"in his mind, in fact we can also say that despite the quotes we mentioned before of a plot where he considers the"
characters that are even though the characters are flat and it has
the tale has limited functions with these elements we could see that rather there are deviations
"there are changes, there is complexity in both of them this leads us to what we are discussing"
my grandmother since my mother left
sprained whilst whilst widen the hole and shrink the head
thanks again to Ruth Castillo we will continue with our discussions
today we will talk about the cosmopolitan narrative but with us here we have leanne
e Bajjada who has a bachelor's and master's degree in Maltese Leanne that I am enjoying
"I started to read about this subject, maybe we can give a little look to what you have mentioned to me here"
the subject they would choose although it could be that they would not speak in public
"about these subjects but they would write about about them, sometimes they would use writing"
to deliver a message and teach e then every writer
the author has their own opinion of and they will say what they think or they will say
it addresses erm contemporary themes that before did not come up so much
in the titles or the picture that is linking to the title
I choose this from this erm in the literature can you explain this to us a bit more?
"over the years that gradually changes, however, the Maltese one"
I get curious to start saying the writer
"this is like when television, we make the programs"
what do the viewers want or do we want to show them what the new opportunities have given?
"new tastes, I mean new types of programs that is"
of personalities erm every week I receive
"several new books that I'll even be meeting with different authors, erm I wished that maybe"
you start meeting the students and see how it unfolds because here the the course we have
A curse is when a person for some reason and another reason of anger or envy
would like to curse the one who
"yes, from this research in fact it actually emerged that they still fully believe"
in the curse maybe e in the verses this belief has decreased a bit
but erm in curses in general they still
"e like the horn, the evil eye is still used a lot by the Maltese"
thanks again to ruth castillo with the eight o'clock news update
"from the news let's move on to literature, you know that last week we had Doctor Adrian Grima who spoke to us"
about the diploma in Maltese literature and today we are going to start meeting
with different lecturers who give their part in this course
today we have with us mark vella who is a lecturer in the diploma
the early narrative of newspapers and issues I mean
there is also part of Malta's history there and maybe let's start a bit about 
there is this course where does it begin erm in terms of centuries erm which centuries
this course in literature erm the literature is very vast that so when you start because apart
that you are studying the way it was written
"that are coming, so here I thank doctor adrian grima who I found I found support from and when I sent you the email"
"when I started to listen to him he fascinated me, I said I want to meet the lecturers who will be there in this"
the course because we learn together this is also a part
"who knows eh, who knows ten years or twenty years from now"
"today we don't have, if you look there is always history, you have the past, the present"
it is good that one continues to discover and wishes very much that you also continue to share yourr experiences
"with a good person in here, but now with you the viewers  we will move on for a little bit"
a curse is when a person for some reason and another a reason of anger or envy
would like to curse the one who
the curse there are some who say that it was born with man
and there are those who still believe in it and there are those who even believe that they are cursed
Yanica Schembri Fava who studied this subject says yes
yes from this research it emerged that they still fully believe
in curses maybe e in the verses the belief decreased a bit
"but erm when it comes to curses in general, it still is in fact"
"e like the antler, the eye is still used a lot by the Maltese"
the Maltese back in the time you used to see them coming out with a litany of how to avert curses
with a lot of superstition that then brings the curse
the fumigation against the evil eye used to be done with coarse salt and garlic stalk
spirit and olive leaves which are all thrown into the pan and set on fire
together with a piece of cloth of the man or woman that we think is cursing us
in the inquisitor's palace there are ancient verses even in Arabic
over time the roman inquisition as I have also researched
yes indeed in the past even more than today erm the curse and the protection against it
January January oh merciful oh collector honorary Visconti is on a chair made of fire
he says his shoes are on fire his socks are on fire his trousers are on fire his shirt is on fire
"his belly is on fire, his collar is on fire, his hat is on fire, everything on him is on fire"
like women like me who never married and who struggled with life to survive
these were not nice times the inquisition decided to destroy everyone who
dabbled in magic I have heard from trusted sources that outside of Malta
those who were found guilty or charged with acts of magic were burned alive
it was the year one thousand six hundred and twenty-five and I
and thirty nine other women were accused us of having prepared and sold 
"love potions, potions  that stir the heart and make the blood boil"
spells capable of inducing love or hate and the curse
"they were three hard years, three years wasted at the bottom of the cell of the inquisitor himself"
"of this, whoever accused us will not get away with it they must pay"
yes they have to pay for the humiliation of being beaten with a whip in public
"of exile, apart from that I am being forced to confess our sins"
"and to take holy four times in a year, thay have to pay for it"
because my dress is torn so that we can make a patch in the old days
but now that fabric no longer exists so we no longer make patches
and make this  hair of garlic (garlic sauce)
and still then e in whomever you have a suspicion in since you do not have the fabric
"where one is thrown and then you fumiagte yourself with it this see, because it has been burned"
music like any other profession has a certain technology that is very specific
for music and perhaps one of the starting points of this creed is
how we talk about music how to describe certain things
erm in Maltese itself we also have certain words that maybe a few are
"terminology in English, then for example the ones involved in the"
e in the scope of bands for example words like musical score e
there is the fact for example that in the scope of bands a concert refers to what we then refer to as
during this course emm we explore many different elements of how music and language are connected to each other
I  talk a lot then  on what is a song and even different forms of
"erm I explore a lot of early music, renaissance and baroque music but not only that"
erm one one one of the few e projects I have going on right now
we are also seeing right now on the screen erm and that is a concert that I staged with soprano Miriam Cauchi in Portugal there
erm eh apart from the ongoing projects i'm also finishing my doctorate in composition in edinburgh
"right erm I worked a lot with different artists, not only in the scope of classical music but also"
"in other things since, I have a project now, coming up in February of this year right in mater dei, now there is a Teatru Malta project"
"where we are staging an operetta called 'my Madonna is Better than Yours' erm that is a process that is currently, by coincidence yesterday"
erm I think that at the moment the Maltese scene is quite particular and there are a lot of artists that work with Maltese.
true it is a problem that we have become so limited on social media
you have social media and if it depends what you see it depends on the friends you have and your interests
to click on the internet where we don't notice certain things 
"that is you have singers who are maybe established like Corazon, for the internet you have"
"then you have other people like bands like Brikkuni, Brodu, Mistura that are"
in Maltese and it's an interesting scene there's a lot a lot in fact that wear out
"the fact that they make up things on the spot, the fact that there is an element of sparring there"
"it is divided into different types therefore we perhaps are more familiar with the on the spot method, which is the one that is funnier the one that"
erm there is also a need for the person to be to be so good with the language that at that time he is able to build e
but then you have so many types of folk singing like folk singing in high vocal register that is still known
"folk singing from Bormla, factual folk singing where there you have a more poetic element"
more powerful erm folk singing unfortunately it is a type of music that
"on the recording you don't get its feeling, it's a type of music that you have to listen too"
erm in a live context where you are having a drink
with your friends being being there and it is it is depending a lot on the place and the time
yes emm it is interesting that historically the the way of writing
with the language and the way it starts to develop there is a need to
"in one way or another you need to download the music, so that not only"
"erm I pass it on to you, then you pass it on to someone else through oral transmission "
but you can write it somewhere on paper so that years later others
will be able to play it erm and that has always had a great connection with the
with language in fact one of the oldest examples there is is from the Middle East
"erm the first form of notation that we found, that still exists was just an indication of how the"
how to play the harp for a particular hymn
it was a series of instructions about literally which chords you want
erm yes language impacts a lot the sound of language especially the Italian language because it is a language that
is built a lot on the sounds of the vowels erm it automatically has a certain melody in itself when spoken
"and Italian music is more melodious ,a a particular case for example is Chinese Chinese is a type of language where in the language itself"
the way you say a particular word with the intonation it changes its meaning
that's why we sometimes we hear to Chinese music maybe as
erm because of this idea of intonation sometimes at the end of the sentence
"the word, automatically when we end a sentence the the intonation usually goes down"
in Chinese that doesn't exist because you depend on the sound the word depends on
"and for the meaning of the woed, therefore it sounds a bit strange"
I think we will be surprised that there are so many things erm
linked between music and language and the fact that
e language is not only something that is linked to literature or or writing but something alive
"it has always been bound, it affects many other things in the life of"
em when I did the masters in publishing studies in publication
because I was already working int the field in the field of publishing and
I wanted to study a little more e and since then I've been about nineteen years
working as a publisher and editor ie
I publish books erm as erm at the level that they can be published
it is invisible work as we say because often times the book
but of course and rightly so that it is the final product erm
"of course everyone knows that there is the author behind it, but the publisher is very similar to a midwife"
because he is the one who helps in the process for the book to be born so to speak so that the book arrives
e and the editor again is something even smaller and invisible because it is erm
"apart from the fact that he is not seen and his name is nowhere to be found, however, many times when we say editor"
"we understand, our mind goes to the editor of a newspaper, editor of a magazine"
"that e is a totally different role, it has nothing to do with an editor"
literary editor i.e. a book editor erm while an editor of
"a newspaper, of a magazine is as we know it is he or she who leads, that gives the direction in general"
"a manuscript editor, how should I say it, is like is like someone who is reviewing the manuscript"
now it is done digitally but the concept is that erm
"and he reviews it with the author e like another pair of other eyes, the idea is that the author"
"he wrote a manuscript erm but like everything in the world, when you have done it yourself you cannot be objective"
because you wrote it yourself there might be things you don't see or would like to discuss with someone else
"and sometimes you also go into detail, sometimes the novel has to be almost dismantled and rebuilt from, with the author"
"maybe you saw pieces that are not working, here there are pieces that maybe are not credible or here there are pieces"
"for example the pace slows down a bit, I need to see if I can increase it a bit"
"e these are the two e tenets, exactly two units e in this diploma that I am feel"
"people where editing is taught here in Malta, but even outside of Malta you won't find many because it is"
"as you teach it, that is not much merit to the organization of this diploma"
teenage children's literature is obviously a field
enormous e all children's literature more or less we
erm are in touch with it either because one is a parent or because e
"one maybe buys his children books or reads children's books for others children, that is, it is a vast field"
e until a few years ago erm the history of children's literature as we are saying
this has been going for many years but it was always considered as something
"wrongly, I mean it looks like something easier because that is for children"
"however, themes are touched on, that is, even in Malta itself, that is, for example, as you are saying for example"
"there are books, for example this one comes to mind The Cats on the Beach which treats in a delicate way for children"
"death, therefore you have, that is it is dealt with in an indirect way, you have em"
a public garden inside sliema where you have the
you have cats in the public garden and you have an elderly couple taking care of them
one day one of the two elders e doesn't  doesn't go back and so he is facing indirectly
the theme that e this that people eventually die
"i.e. the same now you have that, that's exactly i.e"
a family that has a parent in prison where there is a father named joe joan's room is worth the child whose father for
"some reason he is in prison, that is, he is facing this, this, this, this forced distancing that"
"can be created in a family, i mean these are not themes e that's it simple but they are treated in a e way"
obviously delicitale they are not treated as it is treated in adult literature although
e you can actually is e the-the children's book is an ideal way how you can
how professionally you can introduce a difficult subject
well this is the college of perfect princes this actually
it was launched by her excellency the president of malta precisely because the people did not e
"issues of gender stereotyping where you have a prince e whose father, father, the perfect king"
because he tells him that the role of boys is to learn to fight and become a king but he wants to be a tailor
"and then there he meets a princess whose the same, her mother tells her no the role of the princess is to learn to organise balls"
"serve tea, but she wants to become an architect so they meet and get married actually and she then"
we go into the history from where it all started erm we go precisely in these kind of themes as a book for
"children can touch on different themes, how a book for children varies as e"
"we mentioned before since stories like harry potter some fifteen, twenty years ago"
"children, many films are made out of them, meaning the world of children has changed"
books on on on top the digital world etc. that is to say there is a bit of everything
a diploma in Maltese literature e yes we can describe it as a journey of various discoveries
because on the first voyage of discovery e my colleagues were there 
who helped me get to this first year of the course and the lecturers who also taught us
the second discovery was e let me say it this way throughout the literature
how there is more the socio-historical development of the Maltese nation especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
a discovery for me as an author is a journey as one
particularly the contemporary ones discovered as a reader let me say that's how I recognized
to appreciate literary genres that I wasn't used to reading usually and I could understand
for coming to this lecture organized by the Maltese department of the university
within our project on oral tradition we now have three years working on this project and there is a lot of
energy in it there are many people there are many people not from the university
there are many people that we are reaching or who and we need to reach who are outside the university
today's talk is not a critical appreciation of brikkuni's lyrics
sephora francalanza has done as comprehensive an analysis as possible of these lyrics
in her bachelor's thesis between a song and a poem
naturally she had to narrow down a lot the range of her excellent analysis
so that everything fit in ninety four pages
now we know that Mario Vella cannot be discussed
all in ninety four let alone in a one hour talk
therefore today's talk captures only one feature
but a feature that we think is fundamental to mario vella's lyrics
that is the way he uses the way way way to use this lyric the way
really smart and often subversive
"the everyday language, the phrases, expressions, idioms"
"the proverbs, the metaphors we use to talk, to understand"
"to reason, to explain, to challenge the world we live in"
but this rich raw material the lyricist works it well before using it
"he does not simply reproduce it, he is an intelligent manipulator of everyday language"
a critical voice that is served by the language of the very realities it wants to criticize
"in the first verses of a song that I can say, that I will use a cliché"
"I don't grow tired of hearing it, I never grow tired of hearing it, rub al khali mario vella mario vella says"
"please don't throw me in a basket with the rest of, a very small example"
"sephora is going to go into a lot more detail, under the image of that basket there is the echo of the sack"
in the popular expression to throws everyone in the same sack
in maltese we have a number of expressions with mentioning a basket
"and I will mention one or two of them, every dump has a basket"
"for a basket he took an altar of a little, and for his he took a lot etcetera"
"not so much if this was the best choice but what is, what is the effect that you"
"instead of grabbing the sack, you grab the basket and"
"while in the the the echo, in the echo, in the background there is"
"the expression we use every day, on the surface you have this expression let's say, new"
"which is a variation on on the popular expression, our question is what is the effect"
therefore the subject of the talk by sephora francalanza is a subject that touches the very core of the aesthetics of Brikkuni
that the only thing you can predict about their song is unpredictability
because the Brikkuni do not use the established forms of the songs in festivals that often
"with the first four notes, with the first verse, you know where it is going"
"and you decide that you don't want to go with them, the first thing that struck me when I heard the songs of Brikkuni"
it was their refusal to do what most Maltese songs did
"who use the same tired phrases, the same images that yellow with time"
"the same rhyme, the same tonalities, the same easy emotions"
"the Brikkuni of ten years ago had a different sound, those of ten years ago"
"and for me that I am more familiar with the language and its routes, they had"
this does not mean that they sprouted from the scene out of thin air sephora discusses a little
"the maltese soil in which the lyrics of brikkuni probably sprouted, but this is not the subject"
the point is that for many years among them
among them people who had given up on the potential of the music and the lyrics of the Maltese song
"mario vella and the Brikkuni opened up to use another dangerous cliché, new roads"
they spread a whole plain of unpredictable paths before all those who were in search of true emotions
who is able to follow the many paths in music and lyrics
"able to capture the associations, the artistic allusions"
"the historical social cultural references, capable of appreciating irony and self-irony"
"able to sink to the very bottom of the disappointment, of the momentary weakness and the lasting weakness"
"of the explicable sadness, of disorientation"
as you can see many times the theses we lead are research projects that we would have liked to have worked on ourselves
"but we didn't have time and maybe all the tools, sephora francalanza worked on this research project"
"with great skill and passion, but there is a lot  ofother work of academic appreciation that can be done"
each reading is one individual reading that once
these brikkuni texts are texts that umberto eco would call open works
"each time someone hears them they create them anew, they can be read from many different perspectives"
"they are effectively always read, they are heard"
from a different perspective because we are all different
"the last part, I would like to close this long introduction by saying"
a word on what sephora's thesis didn't do and isn't this talk will not be doing
sephora is not telling mario vella how to write better lyrics
"or where he has errors, this is not the function"
this is not her function or of her research
"sephora analyzes how certain aspects of these lyrics work, what peaceful effects they create"
tonight is not a talk about what could have been done before the writing of the lyrics
"it's a talk about what the lyrics leave behind, telling it like it is the song doesn't need "
"an academic analysis, it needs to be listened too, for others to be moved by it, even if"
it will only be those people who create it at the same time
"as mario says himself, the song amazes"
"every reaction, every discussion about it in a bar"
on a social site or in an academic analysis
in the song the elected Mario Azzo-Mario Vella says that there was a notary who told him
"that the words of his song break the melody down because there are too many words, I think you noticed it"
I would like to pass e a comment about about a comment that was said earlier about young people
"I think there are there are different types, people who listen to Brikkuni are people who"
they don't just go for the sound they also go for the lyrics
I'm I'm one of them I like I like to listen to Brikkuni and I go to see them I see the concerts
I enjoy I enjoy the music I enjoy the sound
"I forgot how long ago, it was two or three years ago in a concert that was held at earth garden"
there was a moment where mario changed the lyrics of of a song and i forgot what he said
I know that instead of galizia concubine of the prime minister he had mentioned the conrad mizzi and
"the people when he said it, the crowd rose up shouting meaning the people"
"that is, all this is as a conclusion that the people who go to"
who like Brikkuni they don't just go for the sound but they are paying attention to what is being said
good there aren't too many people here because I can't stand on my legs anymore
I think there is something in the air because even my wife had a sore throat
and a fever blister rose on her lips
good there aren't too many people here because I can't stand on my legs anymore
my knees have been swollen for a week
I think there is something in the air because even my wife had a sore throat
and a feverish blister rose to her lips
good evening yes you I am talking to you my friend you are lucky you know
yes you are lucky because you live in a time where the roman inquisition no longer exists
the roman inquisition was terrifying and anyone could be accused of misconduct
all catholics had the duty to report if they saw someone doing
scenes that go against e the rules of the church
they would be protected by the church and the accused would not know their identity
but before I continue let me introduce myself I am Vittorio Cassar son of the architect
the famous Ġlormu Cassar whose architectural works you can still admire to this day
"and so I also became an architect, like many others I ended up in front of the inquisition"
the charges against me were that I was involved in magic
later I found out that that this case was called de malificius
"I must admit, however, that at the time I did not not find this piece funny"
the case was a complicated one and I ended up in its heart
I was going to make them sweat blood for them to prove my involvement
"even though they managed to find some writing in Arabic of mine, including an interesting table tabulas sibiliana sortium"
"the charges against me were dropped, they warned me not to get involved in magic again and I was freed"
when I think about that time now and how much
there were those who with the same accusations did not end up so well
we believe that we must do everything to strengthen the learning of Maltese for us it is very important that in the twenty-first century
"we make sure that we give a future to our language and why am I saying that, because for me the biggest"
danger our language is today is a real danger because
to invent and imagine other dangers that I say we don't have the luxury of because there are so many serious things that need to be done
and true things that it is a pity that we get lost on imagination and it does us no good
"the biggest risk our country is facing is the internet, online"
"the presence, how much maltese has an online presence today, children from a young age"
find content on the tablet on the mobile on the computer
"that a lot and a lot and a lot of it is not in Maltese, that is already our children from a young age"
e are exposed to the least use of Maltese in their daily lives erm this is something that we have to take seriously
"because if we don't take it seriously there will be dangers, because in a study that was done recently"
it turns out that Maltese is one of the four most endangered languages along with Icelandic
"there is Lithuanian and there is Latvian, European languages to combine to combine as today"
"we use the mobile phone to send messages to each other and what kind of Maltese do we write in? leave the dash out, leave the hyphen out"
"you write to be understood you are not, that too is something that anyone who studies the language knows"
"that has an effect meaning other languages are seeing how that has an effect, now for your question first of all we have to say that"
the university of malta is the university that decides what subjects you should have to do the university courses
"let's make it clear, and that remains up to the university to decide, the same as the mcast does"
"and the same goes for the studies e the institute of tourism studies, they decide at the moment"
it is the university that says listen you must have maltese to enroll and do the courses if you are maltese
if you are maltese it is the university that is telling you what it means means at the moment
if you are Maltese and you are studying in our system and sitting next to you there is someone whose Italian and he is studying with you
"in the schools in Malta and he is about to turn eighteen or nineteen years old and wants to enroll in the university of Malta, he has an advantage over you"
"because he is not expected to pass the Maltese exam, because he is not Maltese, what we are saying is"
whoever is studying among us and here in in our schools is obliged to speak Maltese
let's stop a little ramona because there is something else that is important to say and that has not been said until now
"it is not only with the Maltese MATSEC that you can enroll in the Maltese university, if you are Maltese or Maltese"
the children of those who work in institutes and in European institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg
this program has its own exams and the university of malta recognizes that program which is not the matsec exam
"that is it is important to say this, I agree that the university gave them that chance but I am saying"
"we gave that chance to maltese who are in brussels, in luxembourg, shouldn't the same chance be given to maltese children"
"especially when it comes to talking about children where there is a mixed marriage, where you have only the mum or dad who"
"she or he is maltese and most of the mixed marriages are not with english people, they are not with english speaking people"
"but they are arepeople who speak polish, ukrainian, russian, hungarian and so often"
"in that family I would almost say that they speak or try to speak three different languages, in Maltese"
"a bit of English so that they can understand each other, and with the language of the mother or the father, should  wenot think about those children either"
"in a different way, that is, the same way you learn english as a foreign language and I always mention this we are proud"
that in the last fifty years more than a million people have come to learn English as a foreign language
"this does not mean that it is easier than those who learn it in the countries where they speak English, and where they use, it is taught"
"I'm not talking about that course, I'm talking about these courses, I'm saying this because there are those who come for the three-month courses and there are those who come for the longer courses that is"
"these will be courses that start from the time you are five years old until you are at least sixteen years old, that is not"
"eleven, twelve years, therefore the courses are designed in such a way that if you are saying I have the first level"
"when we are talking about primary and secondary school, most of you are talking about three levels, from the first level"
"to the second level, to the third level, whatever the subject is, whatever the language is, you have to do, you have to complete that level"
that is why it is not true that standards are lowered and thus they are taught in a different way for example today we have
"you can learn italian, you can learn french, you can learn spanish, you can learn german at a level"
at level three it must be eu today I say this when we have the foreign children who learn among us can learn
italian or french or german or spanish why shouldn't they also be given and learned
"that is, rather I say that in that case Maltese e should be mandatory but more than that we have to say"
"that when we see our children doing the sec, now I am talking about Maltese children Maltese children"
"in the last five years the percentage of success in the exam is already ten percent more than it used to be before, I am not satisfied"
that fifty percent used to pass the exam and today a little more than sixty one percent of  of all the children pass the exam
"at that age we end up with something like four thousand and two hundred every year, I'm not satisfied that the sixty percent and the other forty percent"
"e they don't exist, we don't want to see how to help them and then you'll tell me the same thing,  to pass you must  lower the standards no"
"for more to pass we offer adapted programs but with high standards, last week we had"
"a controversy in our country about the bypass, the blessed bypass in Mellieħa and there was a big controversy"
"there were some who said listen, we're going to narrow the lanes here, if we are in favor and I agree that we should not narrow the lanes"
"of a bypass we should narrow the lanes of education, I think that we should broaden education as much as possible but as long as it is"
"high quality programs, programs with high standards and I believe we can improve things that is"
I want to congratulate those who make these programs of the the the Matsec or in Maltese
"of chess isn't that it? the secondary education certificate because that's, because that's what it's called but I think we have to do a maltese"
"I especially relate this to what I am saying at the beginning, in a time where it must be attractive and lively and interesting"
because most of the materials that children and teenagers are watching today are not in the Maltese language
online we have to see how we can make Maltese interesting and relevant for them and I appeal to whoever chooses the books
"and the literature that our teenagers have to do in class, chose literature that is being written today, we have many good writers"
"chose writers where our children, our teenagers of thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years old can see"
"that life that they are living and not Malta of eighty years ago, then whoever wants to do Maltese and specialize in Maltese"
"there is the history of the Maltese literature, our great writers because we have very great writers in our history"
"but let's make Maltese alive and interesting, but you can understand that ir iro the irony that people are finding"
"who will tell you, right then the Maltese children born in Malta by two Maltese parents and they are taking"
"Maltese as a foreign language, why cannot it be done by children of Maltese parents that is"
"I think that those are children of mixed marriages, are you talking about mixed marriages? are you saying they're not children of people from mixed marriages?"
"we should take care of them sure, children of mixed marriages, we should take care of them yes and acknowledge that they in their daily life"
they don't only use Maltese as their main language because as I told you to get along in that family
they are likely to mix two different languages or three languages
probably out of those every year there are some two hundred who either do not sit for the sec exam or if they sit for it
"there they don't pass and most of them are in the same situation you mentioned, the question should be for those should there be"
"a special program? and I think that the actual controversy as a whole arose on this group, on this, because there are those who will tell you"
"e english, poshiness, colonialism, one can use those labels but I say"
"if we if we and I'm asking this as a question, if we are children of Maltese parents who currently"
"they are working in brussels with the european institutions, most of these are parents who they"
"maltese also for their work because they are either interpreters or translators, maybe they are not like that and they are doing another job, after a while"
"certain europeans, but they are both maltese parents, but they are living in brussels e or in luxembourg for these for these"
"we thought about programs, they attend the european schools we thought of these programs for them, those programs"
"they are recognized by the university of Malta, no one imposed on the university, no one told the university of Malta to do that"
"e they took the initiative e in front of the hall and I agree that you give those children a chance, so those Maltese children"
"of Maltese parents, both Maltese but living in Brussels or Luxembourg have that chance to do that program"
cannot that program also be done by children of parents in a situation that may similar
"that's what I'm asking, but what's certain is that we need to strengthen right across without lowering the standard"
"I think that strengthen the learning of Maltese is not a question of whether or not to consult, everyone agrees."
"I understood that's why there was the controversy, because there were those who said no if it is for foreign children"
I say that whoever lives among us we should oblige them to learn Maltese out of respect for us and also to have a society where
"we understand each other more, then the other questions and the mcast and the aj ti es they have too"
"have e-in in order to study with them, you must have mastery of Maltese. I say let's do everything possible so that more"
childrenmore younger people have a good grasp of Maltese they can use throughout their lives
"maltese who wrote in sicilian wi with with Marcello Attard De Vagnoli for example, creating the 'Canzoniere'"
"all in Italian, but he has one poem in Maltese err sorry in Sicilian"
"e and at the same time, always in the stroma of of there is the"
there is the Palermitan Abbot Boccadifuoco who was in Malta who wrote
Intermezzo for the theatre to make fun of 'come parlano corrottamente l' italiano le donne Maltesi'
"and so you have this, I published it, I was d-d-you have here emme you have the Italian figure"
a figure of a canonical pantalone a and who is speaking tuscan Italian più o meno
"what is happening after this, Vittoria the Maltese thinks she is speaking to him in Italian"
"but in fact she is talking  to him in what you were mentioning, in broken Sicilian etc."
but for her in her mind she is speaking in high Italian and you have the aim of the abbot
"who hears her and is saying, oh my and he made the play rightly about him and then when you refer to the servant who never speaks"
"grezzia, but there she speaks in maltese so she has to have a dialogue with pantolone"
e she answers with her Italian which is Sicilian e
and then so it happens that grezzija  go walk like a bird it turns over on her I mean that is
that is to say you have this that three levels I means there is a tradition
